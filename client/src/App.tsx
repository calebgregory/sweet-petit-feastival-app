  with lots of room to play. This event will be kid-friendly and dog-friendly,
  so if you have friendly kids and dogs, bring em!`,
  `You're invited to bring your favorite sweet potato foods. The Feastival
  begins at noon to give everyone time to prepare (or whatever) in the
  morning.`,
  `You're encouraged to get adventurous with your experimentations regarding
  what can be done with a sweet potato. If you have a favorite sweet potato
  casserole, by all means, bring it! But we may not all be able to eat very much
  (lol).`,
  `We've been wondering ourselves, "What would sweet potato kimchi be
  like?", "Is it possible to make sweet potato ..cheese?", "...sweet potato
  wine?  or mead?", "A sweet potato elixir??", "Sweet potato icecream???"`,
  `Unfortunately, we won't really be able to share our kitchen, so whatever you
  need to heat it (or reheat it), you'll have responsible for.`,
  `There will be a democratic process whereby each Feastival-goer will vote on
  their favorite dishes. The person whose dish earns the most votes will get a
  prize.`,
  `At some point, I may create a web form that everyone can use to tell everyone
  else what they're planning on bringing. If I do that, I'll send out an email.`,
  `Well, that's it for now. Email or message me with questions
  (<code>calebgregory@gmail.com</code>), and be on the lookout for updates in
  the next 2 months. Looking forward to maybe seeing ya!`,
